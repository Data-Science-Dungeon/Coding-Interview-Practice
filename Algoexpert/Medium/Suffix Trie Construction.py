"""
The way we can build our Suffix-Trie is to use a bunch of hash tables or dictionaries. Where every
node in the suffix tree is gonna be a Key in a dictionary, pointing to another dictionary/HashTable
(the value of the key will store of the next node's dictionary directly so basically, it will be a
nested dictionary of dictionary). And all the values in the dictionary, will be the other nodes in
the tree whose keys will be a specific letter that comes after the previous letter, and that
points to another hash table, and so on and so forth.
